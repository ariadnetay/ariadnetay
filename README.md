Hi, I’m @ariadnetay :)

I write romance stories in both prose and interactive fiction. I'm working on converting one of my pieces into a Ren'Py game. Yay!

Read Meat Cute, a short gaysian romance story, at https://meatcute.cinnamonromance.com. 
You can also find it on Amazon Kindle, Google Books, Barnes & Noble, and Kobo.
